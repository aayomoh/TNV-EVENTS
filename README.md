# TNV-EVENTS
This site will be the online home for The New Village Events, a modern event planning and
design brand based in Chicago. I want it to feel like walking into a space that’s warm, creative,
and intentional. The goal is to show people what the brand can do visually while making it super
easy for them to reach out, book consultations, or just get inspired by the energy behind the
work.
Purpose and Vision
I want this website to feel personal and polished but not overdone. It should look professional yet
still have a sense of community and comfort. The vision is to make people think, “they’ll make
my event beautiful and stress free.” It should capture that blend of elegance and real human
connection that’s behind every event we plan.
What I Want the Site to Include
● Home page: A clean layout with the logo, tagline, and a clear button to book a
consultation.
● About page: A space to tell the story behind The New Village and what the brand stands
for.
● Gallery or portfolio: Photos and moodboards from events, styled shoots, and designs.
● Services page: Simple descriptions of what we offer such as planning, design,
coordination, and decor.
● Contact page: A form where people can easily send a message or request a quote.
Platforms and Tools
I’m building the site on Dorik because it lets me design quickly without having to code
everything. I’ll use n8n to handle the automation side so that when someone fills out the contact
form, it automatically sends their info to a connected workflow. That way, they get a
confirmation email or their details go into a contact list without me having to manually track it.
Vercel will act as the connector. It hosts the backend that receives form data and sends it to n8n.
Once everything is connected, it should all work quietly in the background. Later, I’ll attach a
custom domain through Dorik or Vercel once the design feels final.
Visual Direction
I want the look and feel to be clean, elegant, and approachable. The beige color I used before felt too dull
and flat, so I’m planning to experiment with new palettes like warmer neutrals, soft greens, muted golds,
or something fresh and modern that feels timeless.
The typography should feel calm and easy to read, likely a mix of a classy serif for titles and a clean sans
serif for the rest. I want every section to feel breathable with good spacing and contrast. Accessibility will
be a big part of this too.
Content Ideas
● Small quotes or reviews from past clients
● Behind the scenes clips or photos of event setups
● A short blog section with planning tips, Chicago venues, and design inspiration
● A newsletter form for people who want updates or event guides
Next Steps
1. Finalize the layout and color palette on Dorik
2. Make sure the contact form connects to Vercel and n8n properly
3. Replace placeholder photos with real visuals
4. Test everything on mobile and desktop for accessibility and loading speed
5. Launch a soft version to get feedback before publishing the full site
